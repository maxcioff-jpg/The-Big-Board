# CatalystFlow (MARC 1.3 Prototype)

Static HTML/CSS/JS prototype for Vercel/GitHub Pages.

## Upload to GitHub (important)
Upload these files so `index.html` is in the **repo root** (top level).

Files included:
- index.html
- scanner.html
- ticker.html
- settings.html
- app.js
- data.js
- style.css

## Deploy on Vercel
1. Create a new GitHub repo
2. Upload these files to the repo root
3. Connect repo to Vercel
4. Deploy as a static site (no build command needed)
